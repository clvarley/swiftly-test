# Testing...
## About

This is a small project designed to test out the [SwiftlyPHP][0] framework and
to make sure it has no glaring issues or bugs. While I've been working on
Swiftly for a while now, I haven't yet had the opportunity to give it a proper
test run and see if it can work as I originally intended. So this is just a
little something I put together to see if it can meet those expectations and to
help me decide where future development effort should be spent.
